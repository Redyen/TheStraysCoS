- In the [[Old Wizard Tower]], we found a concept drawing of 'Rictavia's Carnival of Wonders' and a note saying:
	*For more than three decades now, I have undertaken to investigate and expose creatures of darkness to the purifying light of truth and knowledge. "Hero" I am named in some circles; "sage" and "master hunter" I am called in others. That I have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes.*
	
	*In truth, this "virtuous" calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I felt the weight of time on my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly, must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but whether I shall ever rest in my grave haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.*

- Was found talking to his cart, overheard partially by [[Daera]]
	- Mentions [[Escher]]
	- Says they won't be safe for long
	- Mentions his horse, Driscilla
	- Says: '*your father can't keep you away from [[Strahd von Zarovich]] for very long, this town won't be safe for much longer*'
	- When approached directly by [[Daera]], seems caught off guard and acts stonelike
