NOT [[Strahd von Zarovich]]

- [[Lady Fiona]] hints he killed his own father, the previous Baron
- Believes [[Strahd von Zarovich]]s coming to Barovia was a curse to punish the country
- Believes pretending to be happy will bring sunshine back
- Since [[Strahd von Zarovich]]s awakening (three months ago), the Baron has increased the monthly festivals to weekly ones and become more tyrannical, sending people to ‘rehabilitation centres’
