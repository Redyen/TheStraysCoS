![[Baron Vallakovich.png|right|320]]

- NOT [[Strahd von Zarovich]]
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] hints he killed his own father, the previous Baron
- Believes [[Strahd von Zarovich]]s coming to Barovia was a curse to punish the country
- Believes pretending to be happy will bring sunshine back, as a result he doesnt let any refugees into the village of [[Vallaki]]
- Since [[Strahd von Zarovich]]s awakening (three months ago), the Baron has increased the monthly festivals to weekly ones and become more tyrannical, sending people to ‘rehabilitation centres’
