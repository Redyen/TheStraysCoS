- Grandaughter of [[Madam Eva]]
- Has the power to sense the future, guide its path
- Made a prophecy, with an older womans voice alongside hers:
	"*In darkest night, the light shall flee, No dawn to break, with no reprieve. From the grave, the dead shall climb, Their restless march a baleful sign. At castleâ€™s peak, a heart beats red, Its hunger deep and ever-fed. Should silence fall, the skies shall crack, A thousand souls in torment black.*"
