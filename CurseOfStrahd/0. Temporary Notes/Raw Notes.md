**Session 1 – 12/05/2024**

Suddenly everything becomes eerie and Daeras scarf unwinds and flies away. Daera dashes after it and the rest of the company follows. During the chase, the scarf guides us through the labyrinth of shadowy buildings, while we feel a strange pounding of a heartbeat beneath our feet: until we see a manor arise before us.

We enter the manor, which is abandoned and old, showing from the paintings on the wall. Our dog-man pees in reverence to the paintings, before we continue to the centre of the manor. Here we see a creepy painting of a family with a little girl above the mantle, and we hear a clock striking six, giving us the feeling we shouldn’t linger. Marcus studies the mantle and sees serpents carved into the wood. The front door slams shut, and all lights go out and outside sounds disappear. We see bloody letters appear above the mantle: Beneath this dwelling lurks a beast Who hungers for a bloody feast. He sleeps until the midnight chime Then wakes to feed his dark design. If morsels seek to flee their doom, Then bring toward his secret room A gift to soothe his savage mood But mind the servants of his brood. We enter another room: a dining room with a feast, of which Marcus and Clover cant resist having some. We then decide to split up, with Marcus and Ajani going upstairs and Zoophie, Deara and Clover staying downstairs, investigating the kitchen and pantry. They find a pot in the pantry containing wine, lace with the initial ‘K’, and a piece of parchment saying ‘for the light of my life, G’. When reading this, a knife flew out the wall and embedded it in the wall opposite. They then convene with the two upstairs, who found a note from a servant Klara taking leave, and a hole to a secret room with an amber light seeming like a keyhole. When investigating the music room, we find the harp has a stuck key, which opens to reveal a piece of parchment with a music piece called ‘Waltz for Klara’. When playing this, ghosts appear dancing to the music, of which we recognize Elizabeth, who grasps for the amber shard around her neck as the music reaches a crescendo. We hear a door open in the library, and two figurines on the mantle piece fall over, one shattering and one falling. The female figurine remains. We connect the dots and suspect the lord of the manor, Gustav, to have had an affair with the maid, Klara. We go back downstairs to search the living room, where we find a locked cabinet and three taxidermy wolves that moved when we weren’t looking. Unable to unlock the cabinet, we move to the top floor where we immediately come across a suit of armor that attacks Marcus after he tries to take its shoulder plate. Many misses later, and a tumble of Ajani to the bottom floor, Marcus shoves the armor off the banister, just barely missing Ajani who just got back up, and with Clovers encouragement, Deara manages to shoot it down. We then open the top room, which is a master bedroom, which upon opening shows a figure behind the window that frightens Zoophie. Deara finds an amber shard in a jewelry box with a piece of parchment from Elisabeth addressing Drasha, selecting her as the beasts custodian in Elisabeths absence and giving instructions on how to calm it. ‘Drasha, I have selected you as the Beast’s custodian in my absence. Should the Beast grow unruly or show signs of agitation while I am away, I have left this amber shard to weaken it and soothe its fury. Should the need arise, present the shard and speak the Beast's name; if you speak with conviction, it shall obey you in my stead, if only for a time. But be sure to begone from the house before it awakens fully at midnight. So long as the Beast draws breath, it—not you—is the heart of this house, and no meal shall ever sate its appetite. Should you linger in its domain, it will mean doom for you all. Elisabeth’.

In the bed, there is a bloody kitchen knife dug into the pillow, looking like a larger version of the knife found in the pantry. On the other side of the floor, there is a room with a mirror and a mutilated girl in it, a bloody tentacly nursery with an altar and the name Walter written in blood.

Using the amber shard to open the secret door in the library, we discovered a hidden room with a note from Strahd von Zarovich to Elisabeth (?) and three magic scrolls. The note speaks of how Elisabeth was performing human sacrifices to Strahd and ridicules her for her unfortunes. 

My most pathetic servant,

I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the one who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but a worm writhing in my earth.

You say that you are cursed, your fortune spent. Your husband took solace in the bosom of another woman, sired a bastard son, and drove you to abandon love for madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.

Your dread lord and master,

Strahd von Zarovich

**Session 2**

Having opened the door to the attic, we notice one door is locked with a padlock as another one opens. We enter the room with open door, finding a creepy doll b the window, and a box with a bloody skinny knife, list with names, and a map of the mansion. We use the key to unlock the locked door, which contains a dollhouse that’s a perfect replica of the one we’re in, two skeletons on the floor and a chest. When opening the chest, the ghosts of Rose and Thorn appear above the skeletons. Ajani asks what happened to them, and Rose tells him they were captured there for their safety ‘out of love’, to protect them from the beast below. But nobody ever unlocked the door… We ask them how to get to this beast and Rose points to the dollhouse that we then examine. Thorn then drops his toy, breaking it, but then Rose repairs it. The dollhouse is a live replica, with even us in it. In the dollhouse, a door swings open as we simultaneously hear a creaking sound in the actual house. Zoophie points out stairs going all the way down the house, after which Thorn asks if he can accompany us. Thorn attempts to possess Marcus, which he allows, and Rose possesses Ajani.

We continue to the room with the newly opened door, where we find a chest with the corpse of Klara the maid in it. Marcus looks into a mirror and sees an angry-looking woman we suspect to be Elisabeth. We use the amber shard to open a secret door and descent the stairs beyond for what feels like hours until we reach a dark tunnel, where we hear incessant chanting. Throughout the floor, we find crypts with names from the family , such as Walter (top) and Gustav (south). We find all crypts to be empty. Ajani reaches Roses crypt, and he senses she does not feel comfortable there. Meantime, Marcus and Deara find a journal with Drashas name on it, detailing victim deaths that were fed to Walter, and a wallet made of human skin. They also threw a bucket down a well that was instantly torn up.

Continuing down the corridor, we find two Ghouls. Zoophie throws a firebolt but loses control over her magic and accidentally casts Ice Storm on herself, instantly knocking down one of the ghouls, Clover, and Zoophie herself, only the other ghoul and Ajani standing through it. However, the other ghoul then strikes Ajani, who also gets knocked to the ground. Marcus adaptly brings down the ghoul, and him and Daera help the other up. After a brief respite and a warming song from Clover, the party continues to follow a staircase down. Here they see a room filled with strange objects and a corridor with water in it and a gate closing it off. Following another corridor, through alcoves of skeletons, we find a secret wall that opens to a large room with a layer of 2ft of water in the middle and an altar. We first give some KFC tm chicken to the altar, which a tendril takes. We then present the amber shard and speak the name Walter, after which the tentacles stop moving momentarily.

Ajani then walks up to the slumbering beast and strikes it, after which he wakes up and combat starts. Through Clovers support, and alongside Marcus’ inappropriate humping, we defeat the monstrosity yet it reveals itself to have a second phase! Zoophie becomes Zoophie gigantus maximus ultimus enlargia supersizus, and after quite the battle, Marcus manages to bring down the foe.

**Session 3**

Elizabeth durth spirit looking dishoveled appears and lets a scream loose that makes the whole house trembles and starts collapsing, while she disappears grinning. Before stairs ghost of Gustav appears, begging us to stay and die. Marcus jumps over him, but when Daera tries to go past him, Gustav strikes him and he falls to the ground. Zoophie distracts Gustav with an illusion of Elizabeth, Ajani picks up Daera and the party continues past Gustav. Upstairs, they trust Zoophie to protect them from falling and jump out the window. Unexpectedly, they find themselves in a forest. Rose and Thorn end their possession and appear in front of the party, telling them they vaguely recognize the area but don’t know where from. Daera, forest expert, flies up and in his scout finds a ruined tower. Deeming it a safe resting place, the party decides to camp there for the night.

In the morning, we bury Thorn and Roses bones and grant them their resting place. We turn back to the road heading to the ruined town we came from, but the Death House has vanished. Heading down the road for 6 hours, we start seeing shadows and silhouettes of various beasts and creatures pass through the sky, ephemeral and fleeting. As the last silhouette, being a man on a horse, disappears, huge iron gates appear in front of us with two armed statues standing guard. As we approach, the gates screech open.

 Daero smells the scent of death, coming from a half-buried corpse nearby that seems to have died from exhaustion.  His hand holds a compass and points to a tree that has 13 tally marks on it. We follow a Zimbabwe-path along this direction, and while seeing more tallied trees along the path, we find a thick fog. Entering this fog, tied together by rope, Clover finds himself feeling exhausted. Beyond the fog, we see a body with a dagger in it, which Ajani takes out and gives to Clover. Continuing, we find ourselves back at our original location but now the corpses are missing.

(1) Corpse à (2) horse à(3) à fog à (4) carving à (1) corpse

After some theorizing and not being able to figure it out, we decided to follow the Svalich road. We reach a dark valley surrounded by mountains with a village in it and a tower on a hill, before fog creeps into the valley, obscuring the village from view. Coming closer, we see the village surrounded by trenches and wooden spear barricades. In the village, a raven caws and seems to beckon us to a tavern. In the middle of the village square is a statue of  ISMARK ANTONOVICH THE GREAT (Burgomaster of Barovia. Bane of Vampires. 618—662 B.C.).

In the tavern, a man greets us and offers to pay for our drinks, interested in who we are. He introduces himself as Ismark Antonovich, great-grandson of his namesake with the statue outside. He wants to bring his sister, Irene, to the sacred St. Andral’s church on congregated grounds in Vallaki. The village was recently decimated by Strahd’s legion of undead forces, after which people have been missing. Priests’ son led rebellion against Castle Ravenloft, Doru and his followers, but they never returned and the village was warned to have 100 days to make peace before Strahd’s army would come, and that they did (victims would also turn undead). This, Berovia, is the land ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, who used to slumber in Castle Ravenloft but recently awoke. Only by killing Strahd himself can one escape.

At another table, Deara and Ajani speak to Bildrath Cantemir, the owner of Bildrath's Mercantile. He warns them it is a fool’s errand to trust Ismark lest we end up in a grave, being sceptic about the revolutionary Doru and his followers once believed in. After a while, the door opens, and a woman walks in. It’s Mary, who Ismark proceeds to promise to he will find Gortruda(?) and bring her back. Bildrath gets upset with Ismark and storms off. Ismark kindly invites us to stay at his house, in the south of the village. On the way there, he tells us he thinks the village might be haunted since the undead army’s siege. Not answering any questions about this, we get to his house where Irene opens the door for us.

  

**Session 4**

We enter Ismarks mansion, where we instantly see the Burgomasters (Ismarks father) corpse lying in a coffin in the centre of the hall. Irene has become Russian and takes Ismark into a private room to speak with him. Upon return, her eyes are red from crying. She asks us to help her bury her father at the church before daybreak. We agree and shortly after she shows us to our rooms. Ismask returns and prepares a stew we all share over a good conversation about deities and slaves. We find out werewolves occasionally are sighted in Berovia, where their lunar cycle gives 2 full moons a month. 

When Irene and Ismark have gone to sleep, Zoophie hints at wanting to pay Bildraths store a nightly visit. Ajani and Daero refuse, but the other three make their way there. Zoophie teleports inside, finds a key and lets the other two in. Clover lets his greed get the better of him and eventually wakes up Bildrath by trying to steal from his night table. Bildrath wakes up the Oaf, which Zoophie distracts by using an illusion to make him think Bildrath is outside. After almost being discovered after Oaf finds Marcus under the bear hide, he continues to go outside as Daero uses the dark to his advantage and sneaks in. In the bedroom, Clover fails to command Bildrath to sleep the first time, then distracts everyone using pretty flowers, and commands him again successfully. Through Marcus’ INSANE rounds around the house, he loses Oaf and the party heads back to the house.

 In front of the house, ghouls await us. Daero triple backflips many arrows rapid fire pew pew shoots one of them down, and the other two are swiftly taken down as well. Unfortunately, Ismark is angry at us for having left the door open and letting in the zombies. To make matters worse, Clover reveals that we ‘ruffled up’ Bildraths. Furious, Ismark kicks us out and storms off to Bildraths house. Reasoning with Irena, we promise to leave her house and help her in the morning, as we stay in the tavern.

At night, we share a dream of us all five in a room with an old crone called Eva. She welcomes us to this land and warns us the lord knows we have trespassed to his domain and that he will not rest until he has feasted on our souls. She says to seek her in her tent in Tser Pool so she can read our hands with her gift of foresight. She says it lies west, and the path to her tent begins at a place of death. She says our futures are intertwined with the fate of the land itself before the light in the tent dims and she calls out ‘he’ has sensed her presence, and she ends the dream. We awaken in a layer of cold sweat and Clover lulls us back to sleep with a lullaby.

**Session 5**

We awaken to a knock on the tavern door from Irena, who has prepared sandwiches at the mansion in preparation for the burial and the journey to Vallaki. Walking there, Ajani stumbled over a rat that then flipped him off?! From the mansion, we travel to the church where we will bury Istmarks father. As we approach it, we notice the door is ravaged by claw marks and fire. There, we are greeted by none other than the Oaf, who says Donovich shut himself in the church and stopped wearing his holy symbol. The Oaf leaves and Istmark opens the door. Donovich is in the center of the church, saying he cannot give us the blessing we seek and tells us to leave. Istmark tells him we are there to bury his father and Donovich shows compassion, saying ‘may the Morninglord bless you’,  and reveals he saw his own son return as an undead, who he now has trapped beneath the church. However, ever since, Donovich hasn’t felt his Morninglord’s presence or been able to cast spells, presumably as his son has his holy symbol. We descend, intent to kill his son. The son requests a chance to prove himself, for us to draw fresh blood so he can show self-control. We agree and he succeeds in this test, whimpering extensively and repeating the name ‘Gertrude’. After giving the holy symbol back to Clover afterwards, he warns us of Strahd. Strahd turned him into a vampire, forcing him to drink the blood of his fellows, saying he must obey Strahd’s every order. He mentions riches and weapons, giving us directions.

‘To reach it, the players must cross the River Ivlis Bridge and travel down the Old Svalich Road three hundred paces south into the woods, until they arrive at an ancient oak tree. They'll find the cache nestled in a hollow beneath the tree's roots.’

We return to Donovich and tell him of his son’s mental strength. Irena tells Donovich that Gertrude, who is the son’s fiancé, left yesterday by herself to travel to Vallaki alone. We move to the cemetery, starting the burial of Istmarks father. Donovich informs us of an old Berovian saying that red-haired women often have ill luck travelling with them, and wonders whether we will continue to travel alongside her now that the devil is set free. He says he heard the Abbey of St. Markovia in Krezk was once good and can still offer protection, if we find ourselves nearby. The burial finishes, we return to the mansion where Istmark reaffirms we will take Irena to Villaki, agreeing on a time to leave the next day and telling us Tser Pool is a good halfway point waymark to stop. In the morning, Clover copies the map he stole.

We go to Bildrath, returning our stolen goods, even the bear rug. Bildrath proceeds to ask us to pay him back by investing in EternaLux (pyramid scheme). We each have our transactions with the merchant (2 tents, vial, ram, caltrops), Zoophie makes a mental note to buy Lunar Sight potions in Villaki. On our way out, we come across Istmark who tells us Irene is at a hole north. We go there, find her, who is digging for a chest that supposedly has a keepsake from her mother in it. The chest holds some flowery items as well as a bejeweled bracelet, that her mother got when she could no longer have children. The bracelet says something along the lines of ‘Titiana, … … light even in the darkest times.’ She hands the bracelet to Marcus and shows her neck, having bitemarks on it. She says she is hunted by the devil of Ravenloft himself: being charmed and having her door marked on night one, and her bedroom windows on night two. After a swift stop at the mansion, to pack some things and say goodbye to Istmark, the party starts its journey to Villaki. Shortly into the journey, they meet two scouts that get roped into Clover’s EternaLux Pyramid scheme. We continue our travels until we come upon an ancient oak, with 6 figures standing by it.

**Session 6**

After having defeated the 6 undead, we uncover a buried treasure chest beneath the large oak tree containing a variety of items. Moving along the road, we find an eerie scenery: a crossroads with graveyard and gallows. A carriage then nears, with a young man leading it. Irena recognizes the man as Escher, who she had previously presumed as dead. The carriage comes to a halt, and out steps a man with sleek, tied back hair. “What a pleasant surprise. Good day, I am Count Strahd von Zarovich—and it is a pleasure to finally meet the newcomers to my domain. My friends have told me so much about you."

Meanwhile, a pack of large wolves approach Clover, who had hidden behind the graveyard, and urge him to rejoin the group. Strahd speaks to each of us, knowing us all by name as well as our history. He is angered by us having killed his servants in the Death House and is out for Ireena. However, he is willing to let us pass on one condition only: Clover’s life. As much as we try to resist, our efforts are futile. Strahd is much too powerful for us and forces us all away except for Ireena and Ajani. He opens a large rift in the ground, KILLING Ajani.

While grasped by shock and grief, we hear a strange voice behind us, that in a taunting voice summons a thick fog, allowing for a swift escape.

**Session 7**

The strange figure that summoned the fog introduces himself as Nyx, who is quite jestful yet elusive. As we continue to travel to Tser Pool, a raven crashes down that we recognize as the raven that greeted us when we entered Berovia. Before us appears a large monstrosity with flocks of many birds. We defeat it and help the raven from its chains. It snickers at Marcus before we continue our journey, not having a way to communicate with the animal.

We reach Tser Pool, a merry collection of tents around a fire, where we are greeted by a man named Stanimir. He tells us Eva is waiting for us in the main tent. He also reveals that Strahd was there earlier, to discuss something with Eva. We head over there and she greets us with added titles.

Zoophie The Arcane Tempest

Clover The Heartstring Herald

Nyx, The veil of Shadows

Marcus the Loyal fang

Daera the Sky’s unerring Arrow

She seems fond of the rescued raven as it reminds her of her old pet. She warns us shadowy figures are fast approaching the tent, servants of Strahd, and that we must never reveal the to be spoken words to them, nor that we know the servants’ true identities, lest Strahd will know Eva revealed her knowledge. She then reads our cards:

"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."

 “The Nine of Glyphs—the Traitor.”

I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The wandering soul will lead you to him.

"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope."

 “The Five of Swords—the Myrmidon.”

 Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night

"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight."

“The Eight of Glyphs—the Bishop.”

What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors

"This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness."

"The Mists."

A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia’s abbey, near the mists.

"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!"

"The Marionette."

Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby.

Outside, Stanimir, a woman called Eliza, and someone named Athiri, greet us and offer us hospitality, such as food and drink. While drinking, they make conversation about who we are and where were going. They also ask us if we have come across a man called Rudolphs Rectum, a name we recognize from Doru, who directed us to ‘Rudolphs cash’. Rudolph is apparently in debt to Athiri, but shrugs it off when realizing we won’t be of any use in locating him. They invite us to a game of stories, where we tell a story to make others either laugh or weep and then guess whether it is true or false or both.

  

**Session 8**

The players, everyone in the group except Nyx,  all offer up the items they wager and the game begins. Daero wins it, Marcus attempts to sleep with a man but fails, and we all go to sleep. In the morning, Bradley is groomed. Madam Eva comes up to us and asks us to buy a doll from a toy store in Villaki and bring it to her granddaughter Anabelle. We leave and see a skeleton knight on a horse run by, paying us no attention. Later on, we come across a watchtower with two buried corpses, that Marcus digs up and desecrates, taking their femur bones. In the watchtower, we find a little broken silver dragon pendant, that remains cold no longer how long in my hands, and seems to have faint traces of broken magic.

Continuing, we find a bridge with a statue-like knight on it. He was banished for raising his voice against his commander, awaiting an order that will never come. He is of the order of the Silver Dragons and cannot disobey his commanders will. He is relieved we are not followers of castle Ravenloft, and advises us to speak with Sir Godfrey Gwilym in Argynvostholt. Godfrey awaits those who would raise their swords against the darkness that lurks in the castle’s depths. Argynvostholt is west, beyond the walled town then south upon the ash-gray path.

We end up at a stone windmill with an old lady pushing a cart. Morgantha, she introduces herself as a lady that sells pastries in Villaki. Giving some to us for free, she warns us that guards at the gates of Villaki are confiscating visible silver from visitors. We part ways as we continue our journey.

--- something about the bird and another bird ----

We recognize the sound of a lake nearby. Ireena freezes and asks us to make a detour and visit the lake. She goes there and tells us it is the same lake she told us about in her dream. Uncomfortable, she urges us to continue our journey. Feeling like were being watched, Daera spots a wolf watching us from the shadows: the wolf from earlier, now quicker with its movements. We’re being hunted. We enter a clearing in the woods, and 8 gnarling figures lunge at us from the dark. We deal with the wolves, not without Zoophie turning into a pot plant temporarily.

**Session 9 – 30/11/2024**

One of the wolves was larger than his kin: he was a werewolf. Having died, he turned back into a pale frail man. Having shaken the mans pockets for any lunch money, we head on to Villaki. Outside the town gates, groups are congregated in camps and we see wolf heads on stakes outside the walls. The people seem unwelcoming. As we enter the town, Ireena asks us to meet her at the inn later, as she has people she needs to help. We decide to assist her as she attempts to help the refugees, but the refugees blame Ireena for their misfortunes. The refugees were denied entry into Villaki by the baron with a funny arm, as they were thought to bring unhappiness, so now they are stuck outside the gates.

One of the men in the camp recognizes the pastries from Morgantha and almost passes out. A woman explains that many have become addicted to the ‘dream’ pastries, called that because they apparently put you in the happiest place you can imagine. In addition, they warn us to stay away from Ireena as she is the reason they are cursed, being a red-haired woman. Nyx looks closer at the addicted man and deduces that the pastry takes him out of action for at least a few hours. Together with Ireena we attempt to help others, but they all refuse her help, wary of her red hair.

We head on to the gates, where two guards with silver weapons await us, asking us to prove were not vampires or werewolves. We pass their checks and hide our silver, but have to pay 1 gold coin for entrance. We carry on and find the inn, where Weazy (the bird) nudges Clovers face and flies to the top of the inn. Marcus and Clover rush into the inn with Zoophie behind them and, Daero disguises himself as a guard and follows them in, buying everyone in the bar a drink. Nyx first sneakily breaks into the upper floor and looks around the room there, before returning and entering the inn as well. A man tells Clover Villaki holds weekly festivals and says not to disparage them. Nyx and Marcus listen to a story by an extravagant man in the inn, about a vampire with a wig trying to feed on a nearsighted woman that couldn’t see he was a vampire but instead thought him a pervert. The storyteller is named Rictavia, a ringmaster. He is also from outside of these lands. He announces his resign to bed, but is asked to tell a story on the baron. The inn falls quiet, but Rictavia declines and heads upstairs. The men that asked him, Carl and Nikolai, talk to Marcus about the festival. The baron hosts this festival weekly to try keep spirits up, believing it will keep the devil away. That’s why it is not allowed to talk badly about the festival, even though people deem it a waste of time. They tell him that the baron is rumored to have a deal with a fiend that allows him to conjure fire. This deal keeps the town safe, meaning the werewolf story is just a ruse to scam hunters of their silver.

In the meantime, Daero, still disguised as a guard, talks to a man in the corner of the room. The man discloses a rumor about purple flashes coming from the Barons mansion late at night. Soon after, guardDaero leaves and returnes as normalDearo. We are called to table for dinner by the barmaiden and her husband, who recommend several merchant places in town. When they have all gone to bed, the party discusses strategies for tomorrow before going to bed themselves.

In the morning, the tavern owner warns us quietly of the strict law enforcement system in Villaki and not to speak ill of the baron. Lady Fiona, the mother of Carl and Nikolai, is one of the main people pushing for revolution. Rictavia enters the inn and is handed a package by the tavern owner, supposedly containing lunch. We leave the inn.

The sound of horse hooves nears and we see the baron himself approaching, with a flame-fist guy, a woman, and three guards accompanying him. An old woman gets pushed to the mud by the horse, after which the baron gets off his horse and scolds the woman for getting mud on his coat. She begs for her sons release but instead is taken to the stocks as well. Before leaving, the baron announces the festival be held four days from now. ‘All will be well’, the people answer.

We go on to Blinsky’s: is no fun, is no blinsky! Inside, we find a doll resembling Ireena. Blinksy explains he is commisioned by Isaac(?) to make such specific dolls, not for pay but under threat. Every doll has an even stronger resemblance to Ireena than the previous, he notes…

**Session 10 -** 

No notes

  
  

**Session 11 - 17-01-2025**

We find ourselves in a train with a sparkly ping lizard trying to sniff us. We make some conversation, but meanwhile Nyx opens the door to the next wagon where several ghost like creatures step up to fight him. We defeat them and study the three people sitting in the wagon, also ghost-like and seemingly locked in time. We explore more wagons and find a man that can still talk, who tells us we can free him by killing the last passenger who boarded the train: Josephina of house Cearith, who resides in the last wagon. Apparently the passengers were trying to escape ‘the Mourning’ by getting on this train. We make it to the end of the train, where a hysterical ghosty Josephina awaits us. We deal with her and her two followers and get our wicked sick magic items as rewards.

**Session 12 - 01-02-2025**

We are transported back by the mists to the basement of the old smoke home, where we find a now alive Harkus still fighting the bloated vampire spawn. We assist him in killing it, and return with him to Villaki and Care Compass, but remain confused about how Harkus is alive after we had seen him dead before we were transported. We talk to him and his brother Emeric (doctor) and they tell us that they too were brought to this land by the mists. They reveal Strahd was once a normal lord and has been in these lands a very long time. Strahd is apparently a very proud creature but also very bored, thus has a weakness to entertaining things.

  

After a refreshing drink in the bar, where we discuss our plans, we go shopping! On our way we check the notice board and find a flyer about a Raven abducting young women and one about a missing child. Next, we head to the bookstore where Nyx flirts with the owner and we purchase a detailed map of the town and alchemy book. As we’re about to leave, Clover hears the footsteps of Izek nearing with his entourage. We hide inside as they pass, and Ireena says she would rather avoid the man so obsessed with her. 

  
  

**Session 13 - 21-02-2025**

  

Church arc 1

  

**Session 14**

Church arc 2 - fight 

  

Nyx snuck into the back of the house, all the way to the highest floor where he located the bones to be in the closet. Taking them out, he triggered an alarm blaring ‘is no fun, is no Blinsky’. As a reaction to it, he swiftly jumped out the window, followed by a huge spider-woman. At the front of the house, [coffin maker] gets frightened by the alarm going off, but Clover manages to charm him into leaving the house. Instead, clover walks into the house where he finds another spiderwoman. Marcus, who had been off on his own, enters the scene after having tracked the smell of the bones to the house. After much struggle, and succesfully suggesting one of the enemies to go kiss the baron, we win the battle. We entrust [church owner] to take [coffin maker] back to the church, as we ourselves head back to the Blue Inn to rest up.

At the blue inn, we eat and drink and chat with some other guests. After Clover gets harshly rejected by the other bard, Rictavia, and Nyx finished making his alchemic potions, Deara attempts to start talking about plans. He barely gets the name ‘Strahd’ out of his mouth before Marcus picks him up and sprints out of the inn. Nyx turns into a guard and patrols around the mansion, and Zoophie follows after them, meeting them at the barons house. We stake out there for a little while, but give up as our fatigue sets in. However, right as we are about to leave, we see the purple flashes we’d heard about. Deara flies up to try see more, and sees a man reading a magic book and at intervals draw magic sigils on the floor below a carpet. Daera recognizes it as teleportation magic, but the spell keeps feeling. He also sees a skeleton cat? We decide to head back to the inn to get some rest.

  

Clover dreams that he’s sitting in a ruggedy chair in a hut, with broken glass beneath his feet. He is starving and has a taste of sulfur in his mouth. He starts vomiting endlessly.

  

In Marcus’ dreams he finds himself strapped to a table, with a man above him. His body is heavily mutilated and he hears howling in the distance.

  

During breakfast, Daero asks [bartender] about the guy he saw in the window yesterday. It could be Viktor Vilancovic(?). We also see Rictavia leaving again with his package of bread and apples. Daera agrees to pay for Clovers bill on the promise that Clover will help him get silver arrows one day.

  

We head to the church, where outside we hear Father Lucian speaking to a crowd of people in a sermon. He speaks about a paladin named Lugdana and uses her example to try inspire the listeners to be good and have faith in the light. The sermon ends and the crowd disperses. We speak to Father Lucian, Hendrik and Millevoi, who is grateful for the mercy we showed him.

  

Hendrik tells us Volenta Popovski showed up at his shop one day and threatened him into stealing the bones, so he used Millevoi to do so. It was the spiderwoman in the golden dress. She’s probably some sort of vampire, he says. Apparently she was looking for them to present them as a gift to Strahd. Millevoi as well, explains his story and shows guilt. 

  

After the church, we follow Clover back to the inn to watch him get rejected once again, this time by the innkeeper. Clover then picks up his apple pies from the bakery and we set off through the western gate to south of Villaki, to Arabellas birthday party. We travel to the forest until we find a clearing with a camp in it. We see a hill with a caravan and large tent on it, with more houses at the foot of the hill. We climb up the hill and enter the large tent. In the tent, there are three campfires with six vistani’s (?) around the fires, watching the chaos. There is an older man in armor, with a wounded leg. He is angry at another man, yelling about how he’s lost his little girl. The man stumbles, but before he falls he is caught by a third man. ‘It appears we have company’, the third man says.

  

**Session 16 - 15/03/2025**

Alexei

Luvesh - strong man who caught him, disputed some family drama

Aragall - wounded man who lost his daughter

Ian - suspect, now dead

Sevet - dusk elf who found Ians decapitated, body by the water, also found a strange signet ring by it. 

Kazemir - dusk elves’ leader and scholar

  

The wounded man, Aragall, tells us how his daughter Arabelle was abducted and how they organized a search party together with the dusk elves to find her. It was unsuccessful, but the elf Sevet found Ian, the prime suspect of the abduction, dead by the waterfall (?), with a strange signet ring by him. We agree to help find his daughter and he tells us to speak to Kazemir, the leader of the dusk elves and a great scholar. After talking to various people outside the main tent, we visit Kazemir in his home. *Ring*

  

Kazemir tells us his family’s backstory. He says four centuries ago, it wasn't Strahd who destroyed the peace but his father Baroven. Eroven, the leader of Kazemirs clan, defied Strahd and thus initiated a war with Baroven. Once Strahd took over, he was even more ruthless than his father and less than a mere 100 elves survived. Celebrating his victory, Strahd renamed the land to Barovia while the dusk elves hide amongst the Vistani. 

  

We leave his house and return to talking to people, this time more specifically about Ian. Nyx breaks into Ians home and finds a journal with descriptive information about Arabelle and the initials T.D. on it. Asking Luvesh and Aragall about it, they say it might refer to Talon Dragovich. We find Sevet and he gives us directions to where he found Ians body, while also saying that the his head was cut off in a strangely clean way. Nyx finds Talon, the old lady Marcus spoke to earlier that seemed to think Arabella was a bad kid who deserved to be kidnapped. 

  

On our way to the location Sevet found Ians body, we cross a bridge and notice a white handkerchief stuck on a branch with the initials R.V.R.. 

  

Fight with threes

  

Daero investigates the site where Ians body was found and finds three sets of footprints:

1: From the north, ends by shrub - The person who died

2: From the north, ends by a tree 30 ft down southwest - Disappeared into the canopy

3: From the west?, ends by the river - Heavier, as if it was carrying a child

  

Asking Kazemir → Rudolf van Ricktum

Go to Barons house → infiltrate → at attic

  

**Session 17 - 12/04/2025**

The man that has opened the door and is in the attic room demands to know why the guard brought adventurers to the attic. He is the son of the Baron. We convince him the rat catching story. Spellbook belonged to an old mage called Kazahn, the symbol on it is his sigil. 

Spirits, teleportation magic, dead wife

  

He is looking for Kazahns staff, which he believes he can use to restore his dead wife. It is located in the old wizard tower by Lake Barotok(?) in the West. He refers us for guidance to old hunter Zoldar, one of the town's most skilled hunters. They, Zoldar and Yevgeni, live in the ramshackle hut in the west. To get there, travel north, then west along the lake.

  

We leave through the window and over the fence and make our way to the mansion of Marcus’ date. A butler opens the door, Deara hangs his bow on the coat rack, and we make our way upstairs into the dining room. Marcus is studying the family portraits on the wall when he notices a young woman standing in the entrance to the room. Marcus attempts to talk to her but she is unresponsive, and then a young man appears behind her: Nikolai. He is surprised by how Stella got there, but sends her back upstairs. ‘She is not fully here’ he explains to Marcus. Fiona appears behind both of them as well and tells Nikolai to dress her up warmly when taking her for a walk.

  

Talk about backgrounds and sit down at dinner table.

  

Lady Fiona opens the conversation on our opinions of Villaki and the Baron, hinting that the Baron killed his own father. She explains the baron believes Strahds coming was a curse to punish the country and that pretending to be happy will bring sunshine back. Ever since Strahd's awakening three months ago, the Baron has increased the monthly festivals to weekly ones and become more tyrannical, sending people to ‘rehabilitation centres’. His right hand man, Izek, does his bidding on the streets and punishes people etc. Izek had a family but after his sister went missing, his parents went mad and they didn’t find her body they found Izeks sisters dead body. Those who tormented Izek for being a weird child, disappeared mysteriously as well. Izek was adopted by the baron and at his 16th birthday, and somehow got a new arm on the same day the previous baron died. This new arm gave Izek the power to conjure fire.

  

We agree to kill Izek and help Fiona with her coup d’état. Before we leave, Marcus asks about Stella. She was close with Victor, two months ago Izek brought her back in a state where she could not speak, walk, or do anything. 

  

When we get back to the inn, it is a mess. Broken tables, chairs, windows, and more. Izek came in demanding Ireena’s location, tearing the inn apart to find her.

  

**Session 18 - 16/05/2025**

  

Nyx had a spooky dream about a white hair in his hands but hasn’t shared as of yet

  

Ernst, lady Fiona’s henchman, meets us at the inn in the morning and tells us Izek receives his afternoon meal with a case containing 2 bottles of wine. Izeks butler has a soft spot for pies from old lady outside. Apparently 2 days ago Izek was attacked with an exploding crystal by a lady in a bridal gown. We leave Villaki and travel north until we come upon a lake by a mountain, at which we turn west until we find Zoldars hut. He completely rips us off making him pay 8 gold and tells us about a werewolf pack around these parts as we travel together. 

  

→ breaking into the carts trapdoor, befriend chicken

→ go into tower, Nyx finds:

- Drawing saying Rictavia’s Carnival of Wonders
    
- Text saying: 
    

For more than three decades now, I have undertaken to investigate and expose creatures of darkness to the purifying light of truth and knowledge. "Hero" I am named in some circles; "sage" and "master hunter" I am called in others. That I have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes.

In truth, this "virtuous" calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I felt the weight of time on my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly, must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but whether I shall ever rest in my grave haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.

→ Gargoyles appear downstairs that we fight

→ Investigated broken pots of paint at the bottom of the lake, we know Rictavia’s cart is at the shipyard thing place, the paint traces lead there as well

  

**Session 19 - 22/06/2025**

After much debating what is east, and whether we should force Deabra to talk to the chicken again, we set off east to follow tracks we have not followed before. After a while we see a cloaked man catching up with us: Zoldar. He thought we were calling him, but doesn’t know of any Ismerelda. He does know of Kazahn, who was rumoured to have stood up to Strahd many hundreds of years ago. The tracks end, but we recognize paint by it with the same colors as that of Rictavia’s cart in the shipyard. We turn and head to Villaki, and at one point see a large figure and a woman. Zoldar seems careful, not recognizing them. They are experienced trappers, and tell us about an otherworldly woman with a blade that murders innocents around these parts. They are clearly entertained by this tale. When they suspect we don’t have much silver, they transform into werewolfies!!!! Marcus is absolutely outdominated for a round and Nyx keeps going down, but on his third attempt strikes the last werewolf down. However, an earlier bite has  left him with a setting curse of lycanthropy. We make haste to return to Villaki, where Zoldar says his goodbyes with a warning about Nyx’s curse. Clover persuades the guard to let us in without paying the fee. In town, we rush to the town square where we see Izek already eating his meal and drinking the purple wine. We were too late to identify who the chef is or where the butler is. We continue to the stockyard, where Rictavia is kneeling by his cart.

  

Deabra overhears Rictavia talking to the wheel, mentioning the name Escher [= vampire who was with Strahd when Ajani died]. Rictavia also says they won’t be safe here for long. Lastly he overhears Rictavia mentioning Driscilla [Rictavia’s horse, mentioned first night in Villaki] and saying: ‘your father can’t keep you away from Strahd for very long, this town isn’t gonna be safe for very long’. Deara chooses to walk at him directly and they make some conversation, however, Rictavia seems to hold himself quite stonelike, as if caught off guard.

  

→ Need to question Rictavia

→ Arabelle still missing, Rictavia suspect

→ What’s in Rictavia’s cart?

→ Ireena poster that she is armed and dangerous, should check

→ we are still looking for Kazahn’s staff for Victor

→ Ismerelda might have the staff

→ Attempting to poison Izek

**

**Session 20: 11-07-2025**
We return to the [[Blue Water Inn]]. [[Clover D Hammerstrike]] leaves early, wanting to sleep outside to save money. [[Rictavia]] walks in and sits down at the table, and [[Zoophie Korhen]] recognizes him as a half-elf. [[Rictavia]] says he's come to Barovia a few months ago, but is 80 years old otherwise. He was married to a woman named Inge and had a daughter together named Eli, but we cant tell what really happened there. He has accepted he will never return to Faerûn, but points out Nyx isn't from Faerûn and pries a little. When [[Daera]] mentions [[Escher]], [[Rictavia]] seems to react very slightly and suggests talking further upstairs. In his room, he draws his sword and asks us to prove where our allegiance lies. When [[Nyx]] shows him [[Kazahn]]s ring, he flicks his blade and demands to know how we got that. When [[Nyx]] shows him the note we found in the [[Old Wizard Tower]], he closes the door and windows of the room, takes off his hat and starts changing his shape: he is [[Rudolph Van Richten]]! He had been laying low in the tower, when he spotted a vestani man carrying a wriggling sack to a golden-haired vampire spawn: [[Escher]]. Rudolph had run into the vampire before. He attacked them, killing the vestani man and rescuing Arabella, but the vampire escaped. In the battle he lost his ring ([[Kazahn]]s ring). [[Rudolph Van Richten]] then used his magic ring to discover the history of what happened, and saw [[Strahd von Zarovich]] was looking for her. Thus, he decided it was too dangerous for her to return to camp and hid her in the cart in the shipyard. 

Nyx asks about the ring and Rudolph tells that while the ring is unique, the sigil is not. He does not know where [[Kazahn]]s staff is. [[Ismarelda]] is his apprentice, with abilities now rivalling his own. He hasn't seen her in a while, having had a disagreement a few weeks ago. Nyx also asks about [[Victor]], who Rudolph says to not really now. He says [[Victor]] having the spellbook explains why the purple flashes can at times be seen from his room. Nyx asks Rudolph to join in fighting [[Izek]], but Rudolph declines. He reveals he actually had a son, not a daughter, named Erasmus van Richten, who has died. 

Rudolph asks why we were looking for Arabelle, and we tell him [[Madam Eva]] was the one who requested us to give Arabelle her birthday gift. Rudolph has also had his fate told by [[Madam Eva]]. 

Lastly, Nyx asks Rudolph about [[Escher]], who answers that [[Escher]] was an unfortunate casualty, one of the first to disappear when they explored Ravenlofts catacombs. Rudolph was the one who incentivized [[Doru]] to start the rebellion on Ravenloft. It seems [[Escher]] was on his way to the vestani camp to kidnap Arabella when Rudolph ran into them. Rudolph is now trying to avoid running into [[Escher]]. 

Rudolph explains that Nyx can still get rid of his lycanthropy curse, up until the full moon rises and he has his first transformation. While he can't fully get rid of the curse, Rudolph can brew Nyx a potion that supresses the curse and makes him into a docile wolf over a raging werewolf. He would need wolfsbane, said to grow along the shores of the blessed pool in [[Krezk]]. 

Rudolph states he wishes to stay in ambiguity, not step up and either fight [[Izek]] or the [[Baron]], nor take up any mantle if they fall. He suggests we speak with Arabelle. He also hints at that there are those in the vestani camp who have been corrupted by [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. 

The next morning, we find [[Clover D Hammerstrike]] in the inn, surprisingly early. Did he even sleep? What did he get up to? Clover asks [[Zoophie Korhen]] if she went to school, and she fully trauma dumps. They then convince Clover to sing a song, as [[Rictavia]] walks downstairs and hints we can follow him. Thus we do. The town is active with preparations for the [[Festival of the Blazing Sun]]. 

At the stockyard, [[Rictavia]] opens the cart for us, revealing Arabelle. She has a copper necklace with a carviture. She said she had expected us, having had a premonition and left clues for us to find her. Arabelle has the ability to sense the future and attempts to guide it. She says [[Strahd von Zarovich]] is after such abilities. Not even [[St. Andral’s Church]] would be safe, as that is where [[Strahd von Zarovich]] would look first. 

Out the shadows walks Aragall, who comes from the vestani camp. He beckons Arabelle to come out the wagon and come with her. We have a stern discussion with Aragall, which ends in [[Rictavia]] pulling out the severed head of the vestani who had captured Arabelle, alongside an amulet to cast speak with the dead. 

Through asking the deceased vestani, we prove our innocence to Aragall. Then, a discussion arises about what to do next. After discussing many options, we agree to hide her with [[Rictavia]], using his hat for staying disguised.  

[[Arabelle]] thanks us for keeping her safe, and tells [[Rictavia]] it was his son, Erasmus, who kept her company and kept her safe in the cart. She then staggers, and speaks with the sound of an older womans voice alongside hers: 

 "*In darkest night, the light shall flee, No dawn to break, with no reprieve. From the grave, the dead shall climb, Their restless march a baleful sign. At castle’s peak, a heart beats red, Its hunger deep and ever-fed. Should silence fall, the skies shall crack, A thousand souls in torment black*."

She then falls over unconscious. [[Rictavia]] is concerned, as her prophecy bears resemblance to what [[Madam Eva]] told him once. 

[[Rictavia]] thanks us for our assistance and hands [[Nyx]] his [[Talisman of Echos]] (a magic item). Aragall too thanks us and says he can feed false information to [[Castle Ravenloft]], albeit only once. [[Rictavia]] will take his cart with [[Arabelle]] to the vestani camp this evening.

We head to [[St. Andral’s Church]] to check on [[Ireena Kolyana]]. She is surprised by the wanted posters of her.
